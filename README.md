# UniSight üéì

UniSight is a simple, no-frills mobile app to help you keep track of your university exams and grades. It's a small project designed to do one thing well: make it easier to monitor your academic progress without complicated features.

The app is **in Italian** and is primarily tailored for students at the **University of Rome Tor Vergata**, as its graduation forecast formula is based on their specific rules. However, its core tracking features can be useful for any student.
